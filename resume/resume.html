                    <p>A software developer working on the Uber mapping platform.
                    <p>A few projects that I have completed in this role:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I am currently working on a custom geospatial database based on Apache Cassandra. I have
                            created a publish-subscribe framework for the update notifications. Developed a push
                            notifications framework and a UI for visualizing updates on a map.
                        <li>I have built out a continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline for the team
                            products.
                        <li>I have developed from the ground up an application to support a reliable ingest of imagery
                            and
                            metadata collected by the car-mounted sensors in the field into a cluster based distributed
                            filesystem. The application uses a RESTful backend and Web frontend (Java, Jersey,
                            Backbone.js,
                            Bootstrap, HDFS, Spark). The functionality of the application can be summarized as an
                            "Ingest
                            Operator Workstation".
                        <li>I have developed a number of Spark cluster based jobs to mutate the ingested data.
                        <li>I have refactored, implemented and assumed ownership of a Maven based CI build for the
                            existing code
                            base.
                        <li>I have been working with junior team members in the advisory role on a number of other
                            projects.
                    </ul>
