<h2>Employment</h2>

<h3>February 2012 - Present. <a href="http://www.digitalglobe.com/">DigitalGlobe.</a> Staff Software Engineer.</h3>

<p>A software developer working on a satellite imagery processing and Web delivery platform. I work on Java back
and front end development using Java, servlets, Spring, JDBC, Hibernate, JAX-RS, JAXB, REST, GWT.

<p>Some of the projects I have completed are:

<ul>

<li><p>Developed a highly scalable and reliable backend processing architecture for OGC WPS (Web Processing Service).

<li><p>Designed, led and deveoped a satellite imagery order processing system.

<li><p>Performed major refactoring and development of an internal satellite imagery processing workflow to enable
massively larger workloads.

</ul>

<h3>October 2005 - February 2012. <a href="http://www.seagate.com/">Seagate Technology</a>. Staff Software Engineer.</h3>

<p>As a software developer I architected and played leading role in development
of a hard disk drive testing application. The application supports a variety of hardware platforms,
ARM and Intel based with various network connectivity schemes (Ethernet, USB). The application
uses client-server architecture with a custom embedded Linux running on the target hardware,
generic Linux distribution running on the server machines and Windows running on client desktops.
The application is currently in production use.

<p>As a part of this project I completed the following subprojects:

<ul>

<li><p>Provided a vision and designed the architecture for the application as a whole. Played key
role in implementing all layers of the application starting with embedded Linux OS and ending
with Java server code and Java/Swing GUI client.

<li><p>Developed the host server application in Java. The host server is a heart of the system
that supports individual HDD testers on one hand and the client GUIs on the other. The host
server and the top layers of the system use Java with RMI for distributed objects communication.
The host server provides services to the lower levels via XML RPC.

<li><p>Developed the GUI client application in Java/Swing. The GUI client runs on
Windows and Linux platforms.

<li><p>Developed number of Web applications for test data access in Java Servlets, JSP and
Struts 2.

<li><p>Developed in Java software modules interfacing with a variety of hardware
devices, such as environmental controllers, power system simulators, power margin cards, error
injection boards, etc.

<li><p>Developed in Java a number of host server plugins interfacing with databases, middleware,
file and Web servers.

<li><p>Developed in Java implementatons of TFTP and DHCP servers for both Linux and Windows
platforms.

<li><p>Developed the target server software in Python. The tester server and the middle layer
of the system is written primarily in Python and the entities communicate with each other
using XML RPC.

<li><p>Created a custom Linux distribution for both target hardware platfroms (Intel and ARM)

<li><p>Completed ARM Linux kernel port to a proprietary Seagate hard disk drive testing board.
XScale IOP321, ARM Linux 2.6, C.

<li><p>Developed Linux kernel drivers for embedded Linux on ARM platform, C.

</ul>
