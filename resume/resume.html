        <h3>May 2016 - Present <a href="http://www.uber.com/">Uber</a>. Senior Software Engineer.</h3>

        <p>A software developer working on the Uber mapping platform.

        <p>A few projects that I have completed in this role:

        <ul>
            <li>I have developed from the ground up an application to support a reliable ingest of imagery and metadata
                collected by the car-mounted sensors in the field into a cluster based distributed filesystem. The
                application uses a RESTful backend and Web frontend (Java, Jersey, Backbone.js, Bootstrap, HDFS, Spark).
                The functionality of the application can be summarized as an "Ingest Operator Workstation".
            <li>I have developed a number of Spark cluster based jobs to mutate the ingested data.
            <li>I have refactored, implemented and assumed ownership of a Maven based CI build for the existing code base.
            <li>I have been working with junior team members in the advisory role on a number of other projects.
        </ul>
