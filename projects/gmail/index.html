        <h1>Fetchmail for Gmail</h1>
        
        <p>At one point I was faced with a problem of downloading my Google mail using Web interface only (POP3/IMAP
            interfaces and forwarding were disabled for the sake of "security").
        
        <p>I found a project (a library) called <a href="http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/">libgmail.py</a> that did
            just what was needed. Unfortunately, Google had changed the Web interface and the tool did not work anymore.
            The project at that point was abandoned as far as I could tell.
        
        <p>I wrote a Python module (<i>Gmail.py</i>) that deals with Google's Single Sign On solution and retrieves
            messages using Gmail Web interface. The second module (<i>GmailFetchmail.py</i>) receives messages using
            <i>Gmail.py</i> and feeds them to the local MTA (sendmail) to be processed using normal UNIX mail tools.
            <a href="https://github.com/antonsolovyev/gmail/">The source code can be found here</a>.
        
        <p>Before using <i>Gmail.py</i> you almost certainly would need to modify the source to account for a
            particular Single Sign On form details (the <i>Gmail.login()</i> method). You would also need to switch Gmail
            into Basic HTML mode.

        <p><i>Update: these days I just use Gmail Web UI and bother anymore with offline readers. The point, however, was that
        I wanted to read my e-mail my way.</i>
