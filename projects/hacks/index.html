        <p>I was recently faced with a problem of downloading my Google mail using Web interface only (POP3/IMAP and
            forwarding were disabled).
        
        <p>I found a project (a library) called <a href="http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/">libgmail.py</a> that does
            just what is needed. Unfortunately, Google has changed Web interface and the tool does not work anymore.
            The project at this point is abandoned as far as I can tell.
        
        <p>I wrote a Python module (<i>Gmail.py</i>) that deals with Google's Single Sign On solution and retrieves
            messages using Gmail Web interface. The second module (<i>GmailFetchmail.py</i>) retrieves messages using
            <i>Gmail.py</i> and feeds them to the local sendmail MTA to be received using normal UNIX mail tools.
            <a href="https://github.com/antonsolovyev/gmail/">The source code can be found here</a>.
        
        <p>Before using <i>Gmail.py</i> you almost certainly would need to modify the source to account for your
            particular Single Sign On form details (the <i>Gmail.login()</i> method). You also need to switch Gmail
            into Basic HTML mode.
